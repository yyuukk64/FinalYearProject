  dialoguerSentences:
  - I'm having trouble getting to Luna's house. There's a wall of ivy blocking my
    way.
  - Ah, yes. That's because you need the Confidence crystal to break through it.
  - And guess what, Jasper has it!
  - Jasper? Who's that?
  - He's one of the dolls that represents your self-abasement. He's been hiding out
    in the forest, but we know where he is.
  - Okay, where should I look?
  - Head west from here, and you should come across a clearing. Jasper should be
    hidden in there.
  - And don't forget to keep an eye out for any dangerous creatures lurking about!
  - Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful.
