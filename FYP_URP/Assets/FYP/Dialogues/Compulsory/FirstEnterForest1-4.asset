  - How can I get inside that house? There's a wall of ivy blocking the way.
  - You'll need a pair of scissors to cut through the ivy.
  - Yeah, and we know just where to find them! But be careful, the forest can be
    a dangerous place.
  - 'Okay, where should I look? '
  - Head west from here, and you should come across a clearing. The scissors should
    be hidden inside.
  - And don't forget to keep an eye out for any dangerous creatures lurking about!
  - Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful.
