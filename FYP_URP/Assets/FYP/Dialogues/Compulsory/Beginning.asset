  - 'Hey there, don''t be scared. You''re in your own mind. '
  - You saw the light and followed it here. We're here to help you now.
  - I don't remember anything. What can I do?
  - Don't worry, we can help you with that too. But first, let's focus on the task
    at hand.
  - You need to collect three crystals to get out of here. One of them is held by
    us
  - and the second is in the possession of your sadness, which is represented by
    a rabbit doll named Luna.
  - How do I find Luna?
  - You need to go to the North of the forest. Luna is lost there and needs your
    help to get back. Once you help her, she'll give you the crystal.
  - And don't forget to use your phone to check your emotional state. It will help
    you to stay on track.
  - Okay, I'll do my best to find Luna and the crystals. Thank you both for helping
    me.
